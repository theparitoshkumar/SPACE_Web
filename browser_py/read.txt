Custom ports are handy for debugging. Python has a built-in web server you can use to serve files on your computer. For example, if you run

python3 -m http.server 8000 -d /some/directory
then going to http://localhost:8000/ should show you all the files in that directory. This is a good way to test your browser.


eg,
python -m http.server 8000
