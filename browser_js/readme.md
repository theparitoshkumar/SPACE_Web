# JavaScript Browser üåê‚ú®

Welcome to the **JavaScript Browser** project! Dive into the thrilling world of web browser development with the power of JavaScript in the `Browser_js` folder. Whether you're a JavaScript enthusiast or just starting your coding journey, this project is your chance to build a browser from scratch and uncover the magic of the web!

## Why Build a Browser? üöÄ

This project is your ticket to understanding how browsers work under the hood. By building this JavaScript-based browser, you‚Äôll:
- Explore HTML parsing, DOM manipulation, and rendering with JavaScript‚Äôs web-native superpowers.
- Experiment with networking and web APIs in a hands-on way.
- Have a blast tweaking code and seeing the web come to life!

New to browser development? We highly recommend checking out **[Browser Engineering](https://browser.engineering/)**, a fantastic book that breaks down the core concepts of browsers in an approachable way.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js (version 14 or higher) is installed. Check with `node --version` in your terminal.
- A love for JavaScript and a curiosity for how the web works! üòÑ

### Running the Browser
To launch your JavaScript browser, open your terminal, navigate to the `Browser_js` folder, and run:

```bash
node browser.js https://www.example.org/path
```

Replace `https://www.example.org/path` with any valid URL you‚Äôd like to load. This command will kickstart the browser and display the webpage.

**Supported Platforms**:
- **Windows**: Run in Command Prompt, PowerShell, or WSL.
- **macOS**: Use the Terminal app.
- **Linux**: Works in any terminal (e.g., Bash, Zsh).
- Ensure Node.js is installed (`node --version` to verify).

### Testing with a Localhost Server üñß
To test your browser with local files, you can set up a simple localhost server. Navigate to the directory containing your test files (e.g., `directory/path/files`) and use one of these options:

#### Option 1: Python HTTP Server
If you have Python installed, run:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

This starts a server on `http://localhost:8000`. Point your browser to this address to view your local files.

#### Option 2: Node.js HTTP Server
If you prefer a JavaScript-based server, install the `http-server` package globally:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

Then, from your test files directory, run:

```bash
http-server
```

This starts a server (default port: 8080). Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

GUI run 

```bash 
npx electron . https://browser.engineering/http.html
```

**Supported Platforms**:
- **Windows**: Command Prompt, PowerShell, or WSL.
- **macOS**: Terminal.
- **Linux**: Any terminal environment.
- Ensure Node.js (or Python for Option 1) is installed.

## Project Structure üìÇ
The `Browser_js` folder contains everything you need for the JavaScript-based browser:
- `browser.js`: The main script to launch the browser.
- Supporting files (if any) for parsing, rendering, and networking logic.

Feel free to dig into the code, experiment, and make it your own!

## Why JavaScript? üåü
JavaScript is the language of the web, making it a natural fit for building a browser. Its seamless integration with web APIs and the DOM lets you focus on the fun stuff‚Äîbringing webpages to life with minimal friction.
